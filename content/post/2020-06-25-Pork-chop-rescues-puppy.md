Last night, on May 31st, a sausage dog was re-discovered after he went missing for days.

He was from Middleton Tyas, North Yorkshire.

They seemed to have found him by using meat. When he went missing, Lloyd, his owner posted signs all over Facebook. Almost immediately, his family and friends all offered to help.

The dog (whose name is Chris) is 7 months old. Even Mandy Butler from the lost dog trapping team came to help. Another dog tracker came and told everyone that treats like bacon, pork chops and lamb would be good to get him back because dogs like meat a lot! It turns out he was right. After 3 days, Chris was found eating the pork chop. He seemed to have ran away because he heard a dog barking and he ran away to a rapeseed field.

And he said he wouldnâ€™t come if people were calling his name because he always got fed up of that!

Lloyd and everyone were happy. They had a welcome back party for Chris and are now happy again.
